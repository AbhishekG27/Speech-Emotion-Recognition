## 📝 Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a challenging task that involves extracting meaningful features from audio signals and using them to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. This project leverages **MFCC feature extraction** and a **hybrid deep learning architecture** (CNN + LSTM) to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection.

## ✨ Features

- **MFCC Feature Extraction:** Extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients from audio files to capture the timbral and spectral properties of speech
- **Hybrid Deep Learning Model:** Combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal sequence modeling
- **Emotion Classification:** Supports classification of multiple emotions from speech, making it suitable for real-world applications
- **Scalable & Modular Codebase:** Easy to extend and adapt for different datasets or additional features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Audio Processing:** Librosa
- **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pandas
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

   ```

2. **Model Training:** Train the CNN-LSTM model on the extracted features:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Prediction:** Use the model to predict emotions from new audio samples:
   ```bash
   python main.py --predict path/to/audio.wav
   ```
